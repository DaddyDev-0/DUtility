 DUtility is a simplistic developer API that has been designed and developed to help Spigot plugin developers 
 by having a series of useful tools that are arduous to recode every project. 
 
 DUtility has been released as a free open source plugin for anyone and everyone to use within their projects. This plugin is still in the early stages of development and I will continually try to update this plugin as often as possible with new features and improvements that are suggested by users of the plugin.  
 
 ### Using the utility
 This project has been added as a maven repo to make it easy to import it into any project a developer wants. 
 To access the maven repo, add the following to your pom.xml
```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.User</groupId>
    <artifactId>Repo</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION AT THE TOP</version>
</dependency>
```
